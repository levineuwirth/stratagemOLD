First Capital Terrain Effects

Temperate: +15% growth on temperate and humid; -1 production on bay tiles surrounding arctic.

Arid: +1 food to all arid tiles, but -1 production to all arctic.

Arctic: +1 food to all arctic tiles, but -1 production to all arid. 

Humid: +1 production to all arid tiles, but -1 food to all arctic.

Elevated: +1 food to all elevated tiles. +1 adjacency from mountains. -1 food from all coastal tiles.

Cannot form on polar.

Subtypes

(Default tile is a 1 food 1 production)


Temperate (without tech bonuses):

Grassland (+1 food) 

Plains 

Small hills

Large hills (+1 production, 1 MP)

Forest  (+1 production, 1 MP)

Floodplain (+2 food; -1 production)

Lake (-1 production)

Plains Coast

Sandy Coast (no embarking penalty, +1 ducats)

Mountain base (-1 food, + 1 production, 1 MP; must border elevated) 


Humid

Humid plains

Lush hills (+1 production, 2 MP)

Rainforest (+1 food, 1MP)

Dense rainforest (+1 food, +1 production, 2 MP)

Marsh (+2 food, -1 production, 1 MP)

Swamp (+1 food, 1 MP)

Tropical coast

Tropical sandy coast (+1 ducats) 

On boundary of elevated: small chance for a waterfall (2 MP; +3 ducats, +2 faith) 


Arid (all -1 food, but higher natural strategical resource chance)


Desert plains 

Small hills (+1 production) 

Large hills (+2 production, 1 MP)

Desert greens (+1 food) 

Desert mountain base (+2 production, 2 MP, must border elevated)

Salt flat (no yields.)

Desert lake coast (+2 food, -1 production) 

Desert ocean coast (+1 food) 

Miraculous coast (rare, +3 food, -1 production, +3 ducats, +2 faith)


Arctic (all -1 food)

Boreal Forest (+1 food, +1 production, 1 MP)

Mega Forest (+1 food, +2 production, 2 MP, +1 faith)

Chilled plains (-1 food)

Small hills (+1 production) 

Large hills (+2 production, 1 MP)

Arctic mountain base (+2 production, 2 MP, must border elevated)

Icy island (+2 ducats, no yields) 

Icy coast (+2 faith)


Elevated 

Singular mountain (impassable; random chance of faith yields to adjacent tiles)

Prominent mountain range (placed randomly within all other types of area: impassable, yields to all surrounding tiles of faith and 1 production)

Elevated hills (-1 food, +2 production) 

Elevated mountain Range (impassable; cannot construct mountain tunnels or fly/airlift

over; high yields of faith and ducats)


Any individual mountain whether in range or not can be a volcano: can erupt, but add +2 food adjacency bonus and additional high faith)


Mountains should have heights and prominences and the top few can be named and give higher bonuses 


Wet

Coastal (1 food)

Ocean (no yields. Impassable until tech) 

Reef (+2 food, +1 faith, +3 ducats. Rare and small, can be destroyed by boats.)

Atoll (singular tile island surrounded by reef: +1 food, +1 production, +5 faith +5 ducats)


3-5 coastal water tiles (1 food) surrounding all land, the rest is ocean (no yields).
